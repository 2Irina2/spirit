Space Propulsion Innovations and Realistic Interplanetary Travel

Android application which contains:
  a short introduction showcasing achievements through propulsion innovations over time and the historical evolution.
  details of different propulsion types, existing, conceptual and fictional, to educate and allow for an overview comparison between technologies.
  interactive feature to journey to the closeest exoplanets to earth using various propulsion methods, to raise awareness of space travel timescales and exhibit possible destinations for interplanetary travel.
  references to popular culture e.g. films, books and exciting news articles to engage younger audience and users outside the space industry to make a connection between exciting fiction/articles and current opportunities in the space industry.

The application starts with an introduction screen displaying a brief history of technological advancements in the field of propulsion. The introduction video can be skipped (and resumed at any time) at which point the home page displays an interactive grid of all included propulsion types. When clicked, each grid element triggers another screen containing the available features.


Upon clicking the 'Details' button, the user will see an image or representation of the selected propulsion technology along with some key information about it. This includes highlights, risks, a short description, the stage of development of the technology and estimated maximum travel and exhaust velocities.

Another feature the user can access launches when the "Journey" button is clicked. This leads the user to a feed of their own device's camera on top of which is rendered a set of exoplanets that the user can interact with. Clicking on one informs the user about several journey details and allows them to embark on the trip. This includes a representative space-time warp animation and a countdown timer to destination planet. The user can still use the device for other activities while waiting for a notification which gives exoplanet details upon arrival.

Clicking on the "Pop Culture" button will provide fun references to fiction or news articles covering spacecraft propulsion to engage all users.



As future developments we would like to add more features showcasing, for example, what discoveries have been made in the space exploration sector and how they have been enabled through breakthrough propulsion, as well as more ways to make use of embedded sensors and physical equipment embedded in the user's device to provide an even more engaging and immersive experience.
